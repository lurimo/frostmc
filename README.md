# FrostMC - Official Repository

  FrostMC was a Minecraft Server Network that contained multiple mini-games (mostly PvP-focused) and achieved the goal of being ranked #1 in Latin America.

# What was FrostMC?

  Started in 2017 as a fun project that some friends and I wanted to do, a PvP-focused Minecraft serverâ€”it had only one game mode, KitPvP. And then we already had a team, including programmers, designers, moderators, etc.

  On 2018, the server got a bunch of new players, so we decided to revamp our systems. We wanted to have everything made specifically for Frost. That means no third-party plugins, such as punishment plugins (ban, mute, kick), administration plugins, WorldEdit plugins, Anti-Cheats, Anti-Bots and etc. Everything was going to be our own. Also, the server was planned to accept cracked clients, which were VERY popular in Brazil, and made up more than half of our player base, so a Login & Account system were also needed (and throughout the years a lot of exploits were found by "hackers" that found ways to login to administrative accounts, but we fixed all of them and we also had a lot of precautions in place for such a thing.)

  The development of everything took a while, but we did it. And after a lot of downtime, stress-tests, and play-testing, we launched FrostMC 1.0 (we decided to call this version 1.0 and the previous ones Beta, since only now we were "ourselves"), which at that time wasn't even a network, only a single server, with a KitPvP mode and some other mini-games like "LavaChallenge" & "1v1" and other specific arenas like "FPS". We also expanded our team quite a lot during all of this.

  The next logical step for us was to expand, add more game modes, and add more servers. The next game mode we wanted to add was one of the most popular ones: Hardcore Games (formerly known as Hunger Games), with up to 50+ players in an arena, gathering resources, fighting each other, or even forming alliances, but at the end, only one shall live.

  It was a long and tedious development, but after a while, we nailed it, and released it to the public still in 2018. With that, lots of new players, streamers, and youtubers started to play on the server. We also added a "Clan" system, which paved the way for "Clan vs. Clan" games in which popular clans on the network would compete with each other to see who's the best. Leaderboards were also added, including "TOP 10" Players" and "TOP 10 Clans", Mini-games also had their own Leaderboards.

  When 2020 came, we revamped some of our systems and also added some new features. We also started development of a new game mode called "Party", in which players would compete through multiple mini-games. The server was at an all-time high, being the most played LATAM server for multiple weeks, but with school, work, and some other issues coming on the way for the main administrators (me & shooyu) we decided that it was best if we ended everything on a high note. With that, servers went down at the beginning of that year.

# What do we have here?

  Here we have the source code for all of our systems. It is not up-to-date with current APIs and is not maintained; it is here purely for nostalgia and historical reasons.

  All of the code here is proprietary and made by shooyu (back-end) and I (front-end).
